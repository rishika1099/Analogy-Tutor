## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 **Explain Any Topic Through Analogies**
Enter any technical concept — from gradient descent to backpropagation — and the app generates a structured analogy using one of your personal interest domains.

### 🎯 **Weighted Interest Selection**
Assign weights to your interests so the app is more likely to pick the ones you care about most.

### 🔁 **Avoid Repeating Interests**
The system intelligently avoids using the same analogy domain twice in a row unless necessary.

### 🔄 **Regenerate with Another Interest**
Don’t like the analogy? Instantly regenerate using a different interest domain.

### 💬 **Follow-Up Questions**
Ask deeper questions, and the app will continue explaining **using the same analogy domain** for consistency and better understanding.

### 🔐 **Multi-Model Support**
Choose between:
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**
- **Anthropic Claude 2.1**

API keys can be securely stored in environment variables or entered directly in-app.
